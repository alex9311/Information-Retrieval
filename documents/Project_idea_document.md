####Pitch/Introduction
Imagine this, you walk around and you have a great idea! Well, great! But you do not have the resources or expertise to grow this idea to its full potential. We have the solution for you: The Idea Tree. The idea tree is a web application which offers a ground for you to plant your seed and let others water and nurture it and grow it into a beautiful project. Just like an actual tree, you will be able to implement, kill, branch, grow and truncate your ideas. Think about it as a Github for ideas. 

Different because it only focuses on ideas. No direct help like standard Q&A. Important is to enable an idea to grow. Finding out how it grows. How to enable a crowd for an idea. 

####Relevance to Course
In order for any project to be relevant to the course, the three main components of the course should be applicable within the project: crowdsourcing, information retrieval, and human computation. For Sparked, all three elements can be found. First crowdsourcing will be discussed, then human computation, and last information retrieval.

#####Crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing is using the crowd to execute tasks for a platform. Sparked uses crowdsourcing in three different ways. The first way that the crowd is used is during generation of ideas. All ideas that have been submitted to Spark have been created by the crowd. The second way that the crowd is utilized is during the voting phase. In order to find the best ideas, the crowd can vote for ideas. Thus, the crowd decides which idea is the best. Lastly, advertisement and sharing is done by the crowd. Individuals can share their idea with the crowd and the crowd can then spread the idea. By directly linking to Sparked, any idea that is shared is advertisement for Sparked.

#####Information Retrieval
Retrieving and comparing texts is part of information retrieval. Within Sparked, this is used to check the similarity between new ideas and existing ideas. The results of the similarity check are also verified by humans so the check does not have to be very fast, however it does need to be very precise. The more precise the IR checking system is, the less faulty checks the humans have to look over. Possible problems with this is that while ideas are being processed, new ideas are also submitted. This would mean new ideas should also be checked against ideas that are not yet accepted or rejected.

#####Human Computation
For human computation to be present in our project, we need to use humans to do a task that cannot be automated by a computer. Within sparked, this is done in two ways during the sanitation check. First, the images and text are checked to see if they do not contain malicious content. Second, human computation is used to check the results of the similarity check. While both these tasks can be done automatically to some degree, in order to guarantee the quality of content that has been accepted by the system these are checked using human computation as well.

During the setup phase of Sparked, human computation is used to generate an inital pool of idea's. These are used as an initial pool of ideas for voting.

####Innovative and Challenging Nature of Project
#####Innovative ideas
* Gives unskilled individuals an opportunity to make money from a small ideas, through the crowd
* Mobile app companies have validated ideas for products

#####Challenges
* There are many different components that need to work together seamlessly
* Getting distict ideas can be challenging  
* Keep users involved and contributing, getting the user to feel invested in an idea

####Motivating the Crowd and Monetization
The possibility to sell the ideas to companies was mentioned. I prefer the idea of being more involved in the execution of the idea. With the site open to use and view by anyone nothing is stopping companies from getting the ideas for free. With something as intangible as an idea it is near impossible to claim rights on it. I think the best way to monetize and have the site be sustainable is to find people skilled to implement the idea and start a kickstarter to collect funds. Fact is that a lot of kickstarter projects don't reach their target. When starting a kickstarter campaign for a idea from our platform however we already have contributors and people invested in the idea who might be interested to donate and spread the word about the project. People that have contributed ideas to the project can then eventually receive a percentage of the revenue created when the product is on the market (for mobile apps at least its easy to get something in an app store).

Also, the idea of ads was shot down by the professor, but I believe that if you can show ads that are relevant and non-intrusive it is not a bad idea. For example, there is an popular idea to make a virtual pet dragon app. You can have a web-crawler search for a similar app that is already available (similar but most likely not exactly the same) and offer the makers of the app some adspace on the site. The ad would be relevant to what the user is looking at. The idea on the site can still be elaborated on and might turn into something quite different.

####Requirements and Specifications
#####Use Case
* first phase
  * "crowd" can submit ideas for mobile apps, a picture and short text block
  * The picture goes through a sanitation check, this is the human computation aspect
  * text goes through IR system to find similar ideas (humans check IR results)
    * if an idea is listed as similar by IR, human gets notification that the idea may be rejected later
  * When idea gets out of screening state, user is notified either way
  * After the idea is out of the screening state, users can share the idea
  * Once the idea is past screening, it goes into the public pool
  *  "crowd" upvote or downvote ideas that are in the public pool in a "tinder-like" application style
  * This can be worked in a different type of application, use as "in between screen" which people see between pages
* ideas move to second phase after enough upvotes (to be determined)
* second phase
  * ideas are clearly defined by in-house experts
  * investors and mobile app companies are paired up to create the idea
  * low risk, low profit margin business model
  * users who submitted orignal idea gets percentage

#####Other Specifications
* Users can log in with facebook
* There is a 140 character limit on idea text block
* The application is in english only, ideas included
* Responsive design to allow for mobile devices
* Database tracks users own ideas and which ideas the user has been shown
* Rank all ideas by likes

#####Original Requirements/Specifications content (from first draft):
Scope reduced to mobile apps for project but possible to expand. Input limited to image + text. User can check the status of his idea or send it to friends so that they can vote. As someone votes, they immediately see the next idea, hopefully keeping them engaged to vote on more ideas. Platform language = English (possible to expand in future).

User Profile should include: Ideas submitted (with status(number of votes, percentage)). Ideas they liked. Hidden: the ideas they voted down, so they don't have the same ideas popping up.

####UML Design
KISS - Design principle (Keep it simple, Stupid!). Each step in the process should be as easy as possible for the user.

####Evaluation and Success Metrics

####Execution Plan
Project execution plan (PEP) is a document that is prepared at the start of a project, in order to provide details about the project itself, its team members, their responsibilities and interconnection or integration of administrative and management procedures.

####Assignment Description
// purpose: written form of your pitch presentation. In details, you are required to formalise the project topic and to motivate in a written form: 
#####Pitch:

* How the idea is placed with respect to the state of the art
* sketch the major components of the project
* Give a rough timeline. When do you plan to complete these components? 
* Explain who in your team will be responsible for which components.
