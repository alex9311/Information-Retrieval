##Final Presentation Outline and Criteria
The overall idea is to structure the presentationin a way that it explains the design choices based on the challenges.. 

###Presentation Outline
####== Contextual == (4 minutes)
1. **Introduction** [2 minutes]
- What is Sparked.. (with example).. Maybe back to pitch
- Use the example of Angry Birds.. A great Idea can be a complete failure, and a seemingly bad or simple idea can make it too the top charts.. -- Flying birds knocking out green alien pigs?? 
- So only getting the idea funded is weird, you need a piece of execution to this! Therefore it makes sense.. 

2. **The market**? [2 minutes]
- "The App economy is bigger than hollywood".
- See the information about jobs and app economy. 
- But several app funding approaches exist! Kickstarter, Indigogo, AppBackr, AppsFunder and AppStori (just show some screenshots and that is is booming. 
- Who are we addressing?

####== Implementation == (8 minutes)
3. **Crowdsourcing** [2 minutes]
4. **Human Computation** [2 minutes]
5. **Information Retrieval** [2 minutes] 
5. **Implementation** - Our stack/application [2 minutes] 
	- Also showing external dependencies. 

####== DEMO == [5 minutes]
6. DEMO: + explenation on the similarity check results? [5 minutes]

####== Ending Remarks == [1 minute]
7. **Conclusions/Final Remarks** [1 minute]
