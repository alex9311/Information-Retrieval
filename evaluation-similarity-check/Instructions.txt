These scripts were made to run from local host for evaluation purposes only to
compare the quality of the similarity calculation of different services.

Lucene: To run the scripts you first need to download Solr following the instructions
on the website. Create a core named "Test" using the schema "schema_testset.xml"-file. The file 
needs to be placed in de folder C:\solr-5.0.0\server\resources for solr to find it.
Add the data from the "Ideas_for_Mobile_Apps_TestSet_Lucene.csv"-file.
After everything is set up running the script "rank_test_results_Lucene.php" from local host 
gives you the output found in "test_results_Lucene.htm"

Dandelion: Running the script "Get_Similarity_From_Dandelion.php" sends requests to Dandelion
to do similarity checks. Since you only get a limited amount of units you need a view days
to do the entire test set. The script fills half a similarity matrix in the file
"Results_Dandelion.csv". Running the script "rank_test_results_Dandelion.php" from local host 
gives you the output found in "test_results_Dandelion.htm".
