True Food,Did you know that up to 70% of packaged foods on our supermarket shelves contain genetically modified (GM) ingredients?  Today thousands of products on supermarket shelves are made with ingredients from genetically modified (also known as genetically engineered [GE]) crops. But GM foods are not labeled in the U.S. despite warnings from doctors and scientists that these foods may not be safe in the diet or the environment. So what’s an American consumer to do? Go behind the label and get the facts on genetically modified foods! The True Food Shoppers Guide gives you valuable information on common GM ingredients brands to look for—and look out for—and common sense tips to keep you in the know and help you find and avoid GM ingredients wherever you shop.The Center for Food Safety’s True Food Shoppers Guide was compiled because you have the right to know what’s in your food! We compiled the Shoppers Guide primarily from direct communications with food producers. In some cases we received company policy statements from consumers who passed these on to us. In addition to written statements we spoke to many company representatives to clarify or assess their position. Products on the RED list contain ingredients that come from the most common GE crops (corn soy canola cotton). Companies with products on this list have confirmed that their products may have or are likely to be made with GE ingredients or have not denied using GE foods when given the opportunity to do so. Companies on the GREEN list have made a concerted effort to avoid GE ingredients and have company policies asserting their position on avoiding GE foods.Features-Our “Four Simple Tips” section gives you easy ways to avoid genetically modified ingredients in any product-“What’s New” brings you an always-updated feed of the Center for Food Safety’s latest news and campaign developments on GMOs and other important food issues. You can even share these articles and announcement with your friends on Facebook Twitter Digg and more right from the app!-Our “Action” center brings you our latest action alerts on simple things you can do to demand True Food!-“Supermarkets and GMOs” lists major supermarket chains across the US and their policies on GMOs and rbGH use. Here you can find non-gmo and rbGH-free store brands and supermarkets that are entirely non-gmo in their private-label brands!-You can browse the Shoppers Guide by category (16 categories in all) in a simple “Green” and “Red” list format or search for products by brand name or food type-The Shoppers Guide also includes the ability to call or email companies listed in the “Red” (those who do not avoid GM ingredients in their products) to let them know you will not buy their products until they drop GMOs-Learn about the risks of gm crops and foods the benefits of and where to buy organics gm crops in development rbGH and more in “More Info”-Join the CFS True Food Network or our new Mobile Activists list and get updates and action alerts on the most pressing food issues via email or text message! We are over 100000 members strong and growing. Add your voice!-Connect with the CFS True Food Network on Facebook Twitter and YouTube While the app contains a lot of brand information we could not possibly include every brand in the country. If there is a certain brand you see at the supermarket or purchase often that is not included in the Guide just send us an email from the app and we’ll include it in our next update! Please note that the Guide only includes a few organic brands as Certified Organic products are not allowed to be produced from gm crops.The CFS True Food Shoppers Guide app was developed by Twinkle Toes Software: http://www.twinkletoesoftware.com/portfolio.html

The True Food Shoppers Guide gives you valuable information on common GM ingredients brands to look for—and look out for—and common sense tips to keep you in the know and help you find and avoid GM ingredients wherever you shop.The Center for Food Safety’s True Food Shoppers Guide was compiled because you have the right to know what’s in your food! We compiled the Shoppers Guide primarily from direct communications with food producers. In some cases we received company policy statements from consumers who passed these on to us. In addition to written statements we spoke to many company representatives to clarify or assess their position. Products on the RED list contain ingredients that come from the most common GE crops (corn soy canola cotton). Companies with products on this list have confirmed that their products may have or are likely to be made with GE ingredients or have not denied using GE foods when given the opportunity to do so. Companies on the GREEN list have made a concerted effort to avoid GE ingredients and have company policies asserting their position on avoiding GE foods.Features-Our “Four Simple Tips” section gives you easy ways to avoid genetically modified ingredients in any product-“What’s New” brings you an always-updated feed of the Center for Food Safety’s latest news and campaign developments on GMOs and other important food issues.

Flutter | Baby Heartbeat Monitor - Doppler Baby's Fetal Heart Beats in Pregnancy Free Obstetric Stethoscope or Ultrasound when Pregnant,There's nothing quite like hearing your child's heartbeat for the first time! Flutter turns your phone into a mini stethoscope allowing you to hear and record your child's heartbeat starting at the 20-24th week of pregnancy. Crisp HD graphics for all hi-res displays! REVIEWS"I am very pleased enjoying the little heart beats! :)""Beautiful and intuitive."NOTE: The zodiac predictions are free; making and saving heartbeat recordings can be unlocked via IAP/EAP. Send support inquiries to contactus @ ittakesavillage.tips; this app cannot improve without your feedback!FEATURES- Live monitoring and recording of your baby's heartbeat during the last 12-16 weeks of pregnancy.- Pulse estimation (beta).- Live PCG (phonocardiogram) readout of the heartbeat.- Save rename and access your recordings for later.- Zodiac projections for your baby based on your due date. What kind of little person will they be? This offers infant and early childhood parenting tips based on their astrological sign. REQUIREMENTS- Headphones without an embedded microphone.- Pre-iPhone 5 users can record and listen at the same time. iPhone 5+ users can record and listen afterwards as the headphones prevent the mic from being placed against skin. TIPS FOR FINDING HEARTBEAT- Feel for the baby's back and place the phone's mic against that spot; it's closest to their heart. Monitor your own pulse to differentiate between yours and your baby's. Your baby's should be over 120BPM and higher pitched. It won't be below 100BPM. A silent room long recording and strong heartbeat are required for accurate BPM.- Bigger headphones are better. The loudest frequencies of the heart are very low and small speakers and headphones won't be able to play them. - Take your phone out of its case. Boost the volume if needed and try to set the noise reduction so you can hear the beats but no white noise in-between.NOTE: This is not a substitute for care from a medical professional. Contact a licensed physician for your prenatal care. If you have an emergency call 911.
Shralp Tide,Check the tide before you head to the beach to surf tide pool or just go for a walk or run.  No network connection is required so you can check anytime anywhere.ShralpTide displays the current tide along with the high and low tides for the current day and the next 4 days.Includes an  INTERACTIVE FULLSCREEN TIDE GRAPH  in landscape mode. Turn the device on its side then touch the screen to see the tide at any time in the 24 hour window.ShralpTide 1.2.4 is no longer supported. There are known issues with daylight savings time transitions and inaccurate tide station data. I have made it available for download for those who want more international tide stations and are not concerned with accuracy. Good news! The crashing issues reported in iOS 7.1 are no longer a problem on iOS 8. So hurry up and upgrade iOS 8 is a great release.---------------------------------------------*** Regarding Tide Station Locations ***Shralp Tide does not include all of the tide stations in the world. It has good coverage of the US and Canadian coasts as well as Australia New Zealand and Japan. Beyond that there is spotty coverage of international locations.As of version 1.1.1 currents will no longer be available in Shralp Tide because they were a source of confusion to those expecting only tides.---------------------------------------------Source code is available under the GNU General Public License.

Read here why!Deluxe Backgrounds features a wide selection of high quality artwork and photography. Thoroughly selected and perfectly fit to the iPhone and iPod Touch screen.What's different about 'Deluxe Backgrounds'?Why do we charge something per downloaded background?Our conviction: We don’t grab our wallpapers off the web and give them away for free. Because behind every photo or artwork is an artist who’s done it. We believe that artists should get paid for the great work they are doing. Our wallpapers are 100% licensed from their artists directly or through our licensing partners. And they get paid a fair share of the revenues. That’s why we charge a small fee for each wallpaper you download.The application itself is free so you can browse all backgrounds and categories.The preview images in the app are slightly reduced in quality to allow faster browsing. It might still take some time for categories to load. We recommend using a Wifi connection for browsing the backgrounds.
