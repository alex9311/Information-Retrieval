"Flutter | Baby Heartbeat Monitor - Doppler Baby's Fetal Heart Beats in Pregnancy Free Obstetric Stethoscope or Ultrasound when Pregnant","Dan Miller-Schroeder","There's nothing quite like hearing your child's heartbeat for the first time! Flutter turns your phone into a mini stethoscope, allowing you to hear and record your child's heartbeat starting at the 20-24th week of pregnancy. Crisp HD graphics for all hi-res displays! REVIEWS""I am very pleased, enjoying the little heart beats! :)""""Beautiful and intuitive.""NOTE: The zodiac predictions are free; making and saving heartbeat recordings can be unlocked via IAP/EAP. Send support inquiries to contactus @ ittakesavillage.tips; this app cannot improve without your feedback!FEATURES- Live monitoring and recording of your baby's heartbeat during the last 12-16 weeks of pregnancy.- Pulse estimation (beta).- Live PCG (phonocardiogram) readout of the heartbeat.- Save, rename, and access your recordings for later.- Zodiac projections for your baby based on your due date. What kind of little person will they be? This offers infant and early childhood parenting tips based on their astrological sign. REQUIREMENTS- Headphones without an embedded microphone.- Pre-iPhone 5 users can record and listen at the same time. iPhone 5+ users can record and listen afterwards, as the headphones prevent the mic from being placed against skin. TIPS FOR FINDING HEARTBEAT- Feel for the baby's back and place the phone's mic against that spot; it's closest to their heart. Monitor your own pulse to differentiate between yours and your baby's. Your baby's should be over 120BPM and higher pitched. It won't be below 100BPM. A silent room, long recording, and strong heartbeat are required for accurate BPM.- Bigger headphones are better. The loudest frequencies of the heart are very low, and small speakers and headphones won't be able to play them. - Take your phone out of its case. Boost the volume if needed and try to set the noise reduction so you can hear the beats but no white noise in-between.NOTE: This is not a substitute for care from a medical professional. Contact a licensed physician for your prenatal care. If you have an emergency, call 911.","Free","Medical","40.1 MB","Daniel Miller-Schroeder","1 star","9 Ratings","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flutter-baby-heartbeat-monitor/id673586996?mt=8""

It has good coverage of the US and Canadian coasts as well as Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Beyond that there is spotty coverage of international locations.As of version 1.1.1, currents will no longer be available in Shralp Tide because they were a source of confusion to those expecting only tides.---------------------------------------------Source code is available under the GNU General Public License.

"ChartSpan Medical Record Organizer","ChartSpan","ChartSpan is a FREE, encrypted and secure app empowering patients with the ability to organize, request and send their entire family’s health records (immunization, medical, dental, vision, prescription, medication, x-rays, lab results) from their smartphone.• What Current Users Are Saying About ChartSpan!""My new favorite app!! I had no idea how much I needed our health records until I started using this app. In the past 30 days I sent my insurance card to the doctor, kids shot records to school and was able to pull up the name & dosage of a prescription I was taking. All without having to make a call, dig through a file or wait on a doctor. I really like having everything so organized! It's pretty cool to know at any time I can easily pull up everything from lab results to doctors visits."" Tracy Wall""In about 15 minutes I was able to capture all 3 cards of my healthcare coverage + 2 dependents info and my immunization records. Just like that, I have data that has taken me multiple phone calls and LOTS of frustration to transfer to myself or other offices in previous efforts. Love it!"" FotoSpy1""The app design is awesome! Love the colors and how easy it is to distinguish which record belongs to who,. Requesting a health record below my mind. I never have to get on the phone with a doctor's office again! Great job!"" Brtczsdklo• Security… How Secure Is ChartSpan’s App?ChartSpan uses three different proven encryption methods to protect your data. ChartSpan not only encrypts your data at rest (on phone or server) but also when it is in flight (transmitted over network.). These three layers of encryption protection ensure that your data is always safe, secure and private.• Will ChartSpan Make It Easier To Manage My Healthcare Information For Me And My Family?ChartSpan was built to replace those annoying manila folders that most of us use to manage our important healthcare information. ChartSpan was built for patients to make healthcare record management simple and easy. You can request any medical record from any doctor in only seconds with ChartSpan. Once you receive your record, simply take a picture of the record or import it as an electronic fax, pdf or email. Users can easily search those records or send them to a recipient's fax or email address directly from ChartSpan in only seconds. • Does ChartSpan Allow You To Send And Request Health Records?You can request a lifetime of records or just a single record from any doctor using ChartSpan. You even have the choice to select how you want your healthcare records to be delivered (email, fax, mail or pick up at the doctor’s office.) Requesting healthcare records for yourself or your family has never been easier. ChartSpan gives you the freedom to easily send health records (immunization, vaccination, medical, dental, lab results, blood work, x-rays, prescriptions)  to a healthcare provider’s fax or email from the ChartSpan App. No more driving around town to deliver immunization records to the school nurse or medical records to a specialist; do it all from ChartSpan, in seconds. • Does ChartSpan Have Some Kind Of Special Technology?Yes we do!  Unlike our competitors, we do not make you manually enter your data after every healthcare encounter. ChartSpan combined optical character recognition, machine learning and our own patent-pending technology to develop an advanced data recognition engine that automates the process of capturing patient records. Simply take a picture of your record or import an electronic version of your file and ChartSpan does the rest. ChartSpan is simple, easy and works with any type of healthcare event. It’s time to put your health in the palm of your hand.

Read here why!Deluxe Backgrounds features a wide selection of high quality artwork and photography. Thoroughly selected and perfectly fit to the iPhone and iPod Touch screen.What's different about 'Deluxe Backgrounds'?Why do we charge something per downloaded background?Our conviction: We don’t grab our wallpapers off the web and give them away for free. Because behind every photo or artwork is an artist who’s done it. We believe that artists should get paid for the great work they are doing. Our wallpapers are 100% licensed from their artists directly or through our licensing partners. And they get paid a fair share of the revenues. That’s why we charge a small fee for each wallpaper you download.The application itself is free, so you can browse all backgrounds and categories.The preview images in the app are slightly reduced in quality to allow faster browsing. It might still take some time for categories to load. We recommend using a Wifi connection for browsing the backgrounds. Browsing while only connected to the mobile network, not Wifi, does also work, but might be somewhat slower.New content will be added regularly, so check back for updates!For Deluxe Home Screens & Backgrounds you need iOS 4 or 5 on an iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4/4S, iPad, iPod Touch 3rd generation 32 and 64 GB (late 2009) or iPod Touch with Retina Display!iPhone 3G or other iPod Touch models unfortunately do not support this feature!Thanks for supporting our artists and us!If you're having trouble with the app email us!info@novitap.comDeluxe Backgrounds is brought to you by {{novitap GmbH}}, GermanyNew Artists are always welcome to contact us.This Application is popular with fans of Backgrounds, Entertainment, Wallpapers, iTheme and other fun apps.","Free","Lifestyle","20.5 MB","novitap GmbH","2 and a half stars","3331 Ratings","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deluxe-home-screens-backgrounds/id352224641?mt=8""
