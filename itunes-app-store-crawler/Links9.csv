Using integrated movement sensors, your iPhone or iPod Touch can record the performance data of your driving. For example, your fastest quarter of a mile, your best 0 to 100 km/h time or your highest speed in a bend. And because the last ten results are saved, you are able to compare your performance with your friends and their vehicles.This is how it works: you need to position your iPhone in your vehicle as described below and start the App. Select your preferred mode: continual monitoring or acceleration to a specific speed or over a specified distance. The following data can be displayed in real time:- Speed (mph / km/h)- Acceleration (G-force)- Lateral acceleration (Lateral G)- Travel time for a specified distance (e.g. 100 m) - Acceleration to a specific speed (e.g. 0-100 km/h)Measurement begins as soon as you activate the ""Start measurement"" button.- The vehicle must be stationary to start recording the measurements- The measurements should be recorded on a level road without steep inclines- The iPhone should either be upright (e.g. in a holder) or laid flat facing the exact direction you are driving in to ensure the measurements are accurate- Once the iPhone is in place, accept the conditions screen by pressing ""Accept"" and then begin measurement by pressing ""Start measurement"".- After measurement has begun, accelerate until you have reached the target speed or until you have covered the specified distance.One last piece of important information:Please always give first priority to your safety and to that of others on the road. Only by adhering to the speed limits and driving carefully and responsibly can one truly enjoy measurable driving pleasure to its full extent.And now: get ready for the next chapter of BMW M. And you can also discover the new BMW M5 Sedan in the App. DisclaimerThis application is intended for entertainment only! Please make sure you drive carefully, adhere to all speed limits and traffic regulations in your respective country and come to a safe standstill before you check your measurements. Do not use the application for speeding or racing. Do not check the display while driving. BMW cannot be held responsible for any damage inflicted on persons or objects of any amount.
